# Slyck
The security list you care to know.

## Status

Still just an idea.

## Project Information

Security bulletins for system maintainers.

Slyck is a curated publishing/notification service for medium to critical
security threats that allows system maintainers to focus on more than just
security mailing lists by only publishing bulletins likely to affect them.

tl;dr: No bullshit. Just security information you care about.
